Wizards and Dragons (study project)

REQUIREMENTS
============

* [Otus Lisp](https://github.com/yuriy-chumak/ol) installed ([precompiled binaries](https://github.com/yuriy-chumak/ol/releases/tag/v2.0)).
* [libSOIL](https://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) installed (`sudo apt install libsoil1` or similar for your linux).

RUNNING
===

`sokoban.lisp 001.tmx` or other existing level number.

Game goal: put all "exhausted" braziers to the grids (that makes a brazier to burn again).

Type `q` to stop the game. Type 'z' to undo last move(s).
Mouse scroll or `=`/`-` to change image scale. Keyboard arrows to move a map.

Green mouse cursor allows a hero to move by one block and push the brazier forward. Yellow mouse cursor simply allows to go to the selected place.

Enjoy.
